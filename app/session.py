"""Shared login/session-restore logic for both the web UI and the MCP server.

Both entry points need the same "restore a saved session, or bootstrap
from .env, or fail" dance -- kept in one place so they can't drift.

Playwright's sync API is tied to whichever single thread created it -- every
call touching a `LitresClient` (this module's own login/restore code, but
also `web.py`'s /library route and `download_job.py`'s background job) MUST
run on that same thread or it fails with "Cannot switch to a different
thread". `run`/`run_async` below are the one gateway to that dedicated
thread; nothing else should call a LitresClient method directly.
