"""Background job that downloads the whole library into a zip, exposing
progress state the web UI can poll (see /download/status in web.py).

The job runs via `session.submit` (the one dedicated Playwright thread --
see session.py), not a plain new `threading.Thread`: Playwright's sync API
only works on the exact thread that created it, so a raw new thread would
fail with "Cannot switch to a different thread" the moment it touched the
client. Submitting to the dedicated thread also means /download/start
returns immediately and the browser polls /download/status instead of
blocking on one long request.

Cancellation note: `cancel()` is checked between books, so it stops the
queue promptly if the current book has already finished. It can *not*
interrupt a single book's download once that HTTP request is in flight --
Python can't safely preempt a blocking call on another thread, and
Playwright's sync API only tolerates being touched from the thread that
created it. That's why client.download_file uses a bounded 5-minute
timeout (see client.py) rather than a very long one: a stuck transfer
self-aborts (logged as an error, loop moves on) instead of tying up the
single worker thread indefinitely.
