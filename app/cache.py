"""Disk-backed cache for read-mostly litres.ru API responses: the library
listing and each book's file listing (used for both size display and
downloads).

This isn't just a speed optimization -- litres.ru's DDoS-Guard anti-bot
check reacts to bulk/repeated request patterns, and this app naturally
produces exactly that shape of traffic: every page load re-fetches the
whole library, and background size checks hit every book's file listing.
A purchased book's available file formats effectively never change, and
the library itself only changes when the user buys something new, so both
are safe to cache aggressively -- this means a page reload, an app
restart, or even starting a download right after browsing the library
doesn't need to touch litres.ru at all when the cache is warm.

Deliberately a flat module-level cache, not a class -- there's exactly one
account logged in at a time (see session.py), so there's nothing to key
the cache by beyond the data's own ids. `clear()` is called on
login/logout so a different account's data never bleeds into the next.
